# Intro to R Markdown

At the top is the YAML section. This is the header.

Rmarkdown is a text file. If you want it to be understood, you need to add a chunk of code
* insert chunk button
* typ e"``` {r}" and click enter

##Text Formatting
* Italics: surround text with * or _
* Bold: ** or __
* Headers: number of pounds 

Inline r code. You need one ` and the letter r followed by the code in between. 

##Chunk options
*include: results of chunk show in final report
*echo: does not include results or chunk in report
